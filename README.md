# RandomPawn
Random pawn generator built using [HaveIBeenPawned API](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3). The use is simple: Just refresh the page and you will get a new pawn.

# Motivation
I created this little project in order to learn to work with APIs, Django and what's more to deploy a real working project(in this case deployed on Heroku).
